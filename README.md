Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning pipeline that can accurately predict target outcomes from a given dataset. 
It demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a machine learning project using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

 Objectives
 Clean and preprocess the dataset to make it suitable for machine learning.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data patterns.
Train and evaluate different machine learning models.
Compare model performance using appropriate metrics.
Select the best-performing model for final prediction.

Key Steps in the Notebook

1. Importing Libraries
Uses essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

2. Loading and Exploring the Dataset
Reads the dataset, checks missing values, and explores basic statistics.

3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical features
Feature scaling 

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation heatmaps
Histograms and distribution plots
Count plots for categorical variables

5. Model Building and Evaluation
Trains multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
Evaluates them using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
Compares models using visualizations

6. Model Selection and Conclusion
Selects the best model based on evaluation metrics.
Summarizes findings and potential future improvements.
